# Leetcode_Problems

1. easy1.py: Two sum
    - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
    - You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
    - You can return the answer in any order.

2. easy2.py: 
    - You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.
    - Return the maximum value over all triplets of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k. If all such triplets have a negative value, return 0.
    - The value of a triplet of indices (i, j, k) is equal to (nums[i] - nums[j]) * nums[k].

3. easy3.py: Richest Customer
    - You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.
    - A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

4. easy4.py: Fizz Buzz
    - Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
        - answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
        - answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
        - answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
        - answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

5. easy5.py: Number of steps to reduce a number to 0
    - Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.
    - In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

6. easy6.py: Middle of the linked list
    - Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
    - If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

7. easy7.py: Ransom Note
    - Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.
    - Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.
