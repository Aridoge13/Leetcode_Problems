1. easy1.py: Two sum
    - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
    - You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
    - You can return the answer in any order.

2. easy2.py: 
    - You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.
    - Return the maximum value over all triplets of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k. If all such triplets have a negative value, return 0.
    - The value of a triplet of indices (i, j, k) is equal to (nums[i] - nums[j]) * nums[k].

3. easy3.py: Richest Customer
    - You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.
